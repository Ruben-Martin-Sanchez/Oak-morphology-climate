-Morphological data.xlsx: Mean values of each species for the four quantitative traits (LA, LW, ILB and LMA) and the five qualitative traits (Leaf Habit, Pubescence, Shape, Apex, Margin)
LA: Leaf Area, expressed in cm2.
LW: Lenght-Width ratio, dimensionless.
ILB: Index of Lobulation, expressed as (Perimeter/square root of Area), dimensionless.
LMA: dry Leaf Mass per Area, expresed as (dry weight/leaf area), expressed in g/m2.
Leaf Habit: Deciduous or Evergreen
Pubescence: Glabrous, Pubescent or Densely Pubescent
Shape: Elliptic, Obovate, Oblong, Lanceolate, Ovate or Circular. 
Apex: Acute, Acuminate, Rounded or Straight
Margin: Entire, Lobated, Serrate, Dentate, Undulate, Spinose or Crenate.

-Climatic data.csv: Average Worldclim variables for each species used in the climatic PCA. See https://www.worldclim.org/data/bioclim.html for further details. "bio20" was calculated ex profeso for the paper as a result of BIO16 minus BIO17. 

-Supplementary Tables.xlsx: Supplementary material containing the five supplementary tables for the main manuscript.
