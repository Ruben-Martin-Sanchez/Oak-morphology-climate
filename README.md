File in this folder include raw data corresponding to the paper: "Oak leaf morphology may be more strongly shaped by climate than by phylogeny"

-Morphological data.xlsx: Measurements of the four quantitative traits (LA, LW, ILB and LMA) and four qualitative traits (Pubescence, Shape, Apex, Margin)
  LA: Leaf Area, expressed in cm2.
  LW: Lenght-Width ratio, dimensionless.
  ILB: Index of Lobulation, expressed as (Perimeter/square root of Area), dimensionless.
  LMA: dry Leaf Mass per Area, expresed as (dry weight/leaf area), expressed in g/m2.
  Pubescence: Glabrous, Pubescent or Densely Pubescent
  Shape: Elliptic, Obovate, Oblong, Lanceolate, Ovate or Circular. 
  Apex: Acute, Acuminate, Rounded or Straight
  Margin: Entire, Lobated, Serrate, Dentate, Undulate, Spinose or Crenate. 
  Leaf Habit: Deciduous or Evergreen

-Climatic data.csv: Average Worldclim variables for each species used in the climatic PCA. See https://www.worldclim.org/data/bioclim.html for further details. "bio20" was calculated ex profeso for the paper as a result of BIO16 minus BIO17. 

-Appendix Tables: Supplementary material containing the five appendix tables for the main manuscript
